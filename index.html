    <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
    <p>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</p>
    <p>There are two major Python versions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python 2</li>
      <li>Python 3</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
    <code>
    # The simplest python code
      
    print("Hello World")
      
    # Prints Hello World to the console.
    </code>

    <p>Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.</p>
    <p>Rules for creating variables in Python:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.</li>
      <li>A variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
      <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).</li>
      <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).</li>
      <li>The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
    <code>
    # An integer assignment
    age = 45
  
    # A floating point
    salary = 1456.8
  
    # A string
    name = "John"
    </code>

    <header>If...else Statement</header>
    <p>There comes situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next. Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code. Decision-making statements in programming languages decide the direction of the flow of program execution.</p>
    <p>The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    i = 20
    
    if (i < 15):
      print("i is smaller than 15")
      print("i'm in if Block")
      
    else:
      print("i is greater than 15")
      print("i'm in else Block")
    </code>

  <section id="While_Statement" class="main-section">
    <header>While Statement</header>
    <p>Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed. While loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration. Indefinite iteration means that the number of times the loop is executed isn’t specified explicitly in advance.</p>
    <p>Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements. When a while loop is executed, expr is first evaluated in a Boolean context and if it is true, the loop body is executed. Then the expr is checked again, if it is still true then the body is executed again and this continues until the expression becomes false.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    # Python program to illustrate
    # while loop
    
    count = 0
    
    while (count < 3):
      count = count + 1
      print("Hello Geek")
    </code>

    <header>For Statement</header>
    <p>Python For loop is used for sequential traversal i.e. it is used for iterating over an iterable like string, tuple, list, etc. It falls under the category of definite iteration. Definite iterations mean the number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance. In Python, there is no C style for loop. There is “for in” loop which is similar to for each loop in other languages. Let us learn how to use for in loop for sequential traversals. </p>
    <p>Here the iterable is a collection of objects like lists, tuples. The indented statements inside the for loops are executed once for each item in an iterable. The variable var takes the value of the next item of the iterable each time through the loop.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>
    # Python program to illustrate
    # Iterating over a list
    
    print("List Iteration")
    
    l = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]
    
    for i in l:
      print(i)
