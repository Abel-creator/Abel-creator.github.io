    <h2>Early years</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tilahun Gessesse was born in Addis Ababa on September 27, 1940, to an Amhara father, Gessesse Negusse, and an Oromo mother, Gete Gurmu.</li>
              
      <li>Tilahun went to Waliso's Ras Gobena Elementary School, where his grandfather was a teacher.</li>
              
      <li>His enthusiasm in music grew stronger over time, despite his grandfather's encouragement to focus on his academic pursuits.</li>
              
      <li>Tilahun walked out of school and attempted to travel to Addis Ababa to pursue his career, a voyage he embarked on without the permission of his family.</li>
              
      <li>He only stayed at his grandfather's residence for one night before continuing his trek to Addis Ababa, this time hiding in the back of a heavy truck.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Achievements and career</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tilahun was engaged by the Hager Fikir Association, which is today known as Hager Fikir Theatre, in Addis Ababa.</li>
              
      <li>Tilahun moved to the National Theater, where he continued to have success. In the 1960s, his tenor singing was recognized as the best Ethiopian pop voice.</li>
              
      <li>Tilahun's recordings from the 1970s and 1980s helped earn enormous sums of money for famine relief. His recordings were mostly in Amharic, but he did make a few in Oromo as well.</li>
              
      <li>Since 1983, when partnering with The Walias, they have worked together to re-record older versions of LPs under Misrach Music Group.</li>
              
      <li>He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree by Addis Ababa University. He was also honored by the Ethiopian Fine Art and Mass Media Prize Trust for his lifetime achievements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Death and funeral</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tilahun died in Addis Ababa on April 19, 2009, while being driven to the hospital by his wife.</li>
              
      <li>Due to diabetes, he had been in bad health for several years.</li>
              
      <li>"Tilahun distinguished out as an artist of great fame with his lifelong contributions to Ethiopia's modern music, which he popularized across the world," Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said.</li>

      <li>"Ethiopians owe a great deal to the late Tilahun Gessesse, who promoted Ethiopian music around the world," said US Ambassador Donald Yamamoto.</li>
              
      <li>A state funeral was held on April 23. Around one million Ethiopians, including government officials and entertainers, gathered at Addis Ababa's Meskel Square to hear condolence speeches from the Prime MinisterÂ and President Girma Wolde-Giorgis.</li>
    </ul>
